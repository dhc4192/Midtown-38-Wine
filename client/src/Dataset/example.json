    "description": "Our Cabernet Sauvignon is a blend of individual vineyard lots, utilizing exceptional fruit from our estate vineyards and independent growers. This wine embodies the complexity of the valley, while offering a seamless balance between fruit, oak and tannins. To add nuance the Cabernet is blended with Merlot, yielding a wine that is approachable in its youth, yet worthy of cellaring.",
